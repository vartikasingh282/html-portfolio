        <h3>Dangal</h3>
        <p>The movie plot is based on true story. Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former wrestler, decides
            to fulfil his dream of winning a gold medal for his country by training his daughters for
            the Commonwealth Games despite the existing social stigmas.<br/>

        <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
        <p>The movie teaches us that a certificate is nothing more than a piece
            of paper. Real education is to acquire knowledge. After graduation, Rancho
            gives away his certificate to someone else, and with the help of his acquired 
            knowledge, he became a great scientist.<br/>
            In my opinion - In this movie you will learn about life on another level.</p>

        <h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
        <p>Ishaan is criticised by his parents for his poor academic performance and is sent away to 
            a boarding school. Ram, an art teacher, however, realises he has dyslexia and helps him 
            uncover his potential.<br/>
