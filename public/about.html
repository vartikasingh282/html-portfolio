<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Namaste, My name is Vartika Singh. I am from Ajmer, it's a small city in rajasthan stat in India. I am graduate in 
  bachelor of arts. And I did ITI in one of the computer course ICTSM. It's a diploma certificate course. I like to learn 
  new things every chance I get. And I like to work with team and also can work alone. </p>

<p>This ITI certificate is given by NCVT Delhi. But it's not like diploma, and I know that. But ITI diploma is also given
  government. It's not fake or any less important. and anyone can do this right after from passing 10th class to no age limit,
  yes anyone can do ITI just need to have 10th pass result. And can get a job anywhere.</p>

<p>I know that I didnot do anything for so many years, and I just wasted most precious time in my life. but I get to know one thing 
  that no matter what you do people will always try THEIR BEST TO DESTROY YOU. So no matter what, I am not going not let others decide 
  what I should do or not do. I am going to make my life better and as pleasant as possible.
